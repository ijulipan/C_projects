// Strings can be declared and stored using a two-dimensional array.
// e.g char strings[5][20].
// However, this is wasting memory as C allocates a fixed mount of space
// for each string, which leads to potential memory wastage.
// Instead, we can use an array of pointers. 

// planets is an array of pointers which each element points to a string
// (which is actually a character array terminated by a null character)
// Each string does not require a fixed size so no wastage occurs.

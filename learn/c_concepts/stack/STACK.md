# STACK & USAGE

## Stack ## 

A data structure following the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are *pushed* (added) to the top of the stack and *popped* (removed) from the top, allowing access to only the most recently added item. 

Stacks are commonly used in recursive algorithms and for tracking function calls.

**LIFO Principle**: The most recently added element is the first one to be removed. This can be visualized as below:

It is widely used in programming for tasks such as function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

An example of how to create and manipulate a stack data structure using **linked nodes** is shown at [stacked data structure](/learn/c_concepts/stack/stack_data_struct.c).
